# eye_tracking_test
Written over around 5 ish hours as a test.
Super dependent on good lighting, no weird reflections, and a ton of other things.
Only works as a proof of concept, correctly estimates vertical eye orientation but fails to determine left-right eye orientation, so it's not terribly useful.
